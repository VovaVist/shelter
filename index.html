            <p class="about-p1">Currently we have 121 dogs and 342 
                cats on our hands and statistics show that 
                only 20% of them will find a family. 
                The others will continue to live with 
                us and will be waiting for a lucky chance
                to become dearly loved.
            </p>
            <p class="about-p2">
                We feed our wards with the best food and 
                make sure that they do not get sick, feel
                comfortable (including psychologically)
                and well. We are supported by 87 volunteers
                and 28 employees of various skill levels. 
                About 12% of the animals are taken by the 
                shelter staff. Taking care of the animals, 
                they become attached to the pets and would 
                hardly ever leave them alone.
